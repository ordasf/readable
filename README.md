# Readable app

App for udacity's React course. The app is divided into a backend server (readable api server) and the front-end application written in React which is the exercise to evaluate. 

To start the application first go start the backend server (see instructions bellow in the proper section) then start the react application:

    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
    
To access the application open the browser and navigate to localhost:3000

# Readable API Server

This is the starter project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that you'll use to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project. To install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
